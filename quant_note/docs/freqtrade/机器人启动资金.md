# Assign available Capital¶
To fully utilize compounding profits when using multiple bots on the same exchange account, you'll want to limit each bot to a certain starting balance. This can be accomplished by setting available_capital to the desired starting balance.

Assuming your account has 10.000 USDT and you want to run 2 different strategies on this exchange. You'd set available_capital=5000 - granting each bot an initial capital of 5000 USDT. The bot will then split this starting balance equally into max_open_trades buckets. Profitable trades will result in increased stake-sizes for this bot - without affecting the stake-sizes of the other bot.
